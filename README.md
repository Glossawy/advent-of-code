Advent of Code Solutions
---

Archive of advent of code solutions. There were solutions for 2018 but they're a mess and hard to cleanup and are not included.

Currently archived:

- [2019](./2019)
  - All parts up to day 17, except for day 15 which was skipped
  - Primarily done in StandardML, using SMLNJ continuations and MLton
- 2020 (planned)

Each year will have a README documenting how they may be built and run with all input files and solutions.
